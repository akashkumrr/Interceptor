## An automation tool which assists in finding jobs online, increasing opportunities and accessibility for job applicants

### Language - Python, Javascript, HTML <br /><br />

### Prime Motivation ##
While searching for jobs online I often found myself reading too many the job descriptions which didn't match my profile and thus wasting time, even after applying the filters given by job boards. Due to inaccurate filters because of which many job oppurtunities were being missed out and, I had to spend time manually going through all the job postings for a role.

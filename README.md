### Language - Python, Javascript, HTML <br /><br />

### Prime Motivation ##
While searching for jobs online by using the filters given by job boards, I was spending a considerable amount of time to find job postings which would my job profile. I often found myself reading too many the job descriptions which didn't match my profile and thus wasting time. 

The filters given by the job boards online weren't accurate because of which many job oppurtunities were being missed out and, I had to spend time manually going through all the job postings for a role.

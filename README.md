An automation tool which assists in finding jobs online, increasing opportunities and accessibility for job applicants

## Prime Motivation
While searching for jobs online I often found myself reading too many the job descriptions which didn't match my profile and thus wasting time, even after applying the filters. Due to inaccurate filters many job opportunities were being missed out and, I had to spend time manually going through all the job postings for a role.

So, I thought of creating a tool which automates the job hunt and helps you find the job you want!

## Features:
 * Manage all your applied jobs at once place
 * Accurate job filters using Regex
 * Save favorite companies and track for new opportunities
 * Get detailed analysis of missing opportunities at every company.
 * It calculates the matching jobs opportunities and informs the candidate about the ones which are being missed out.
